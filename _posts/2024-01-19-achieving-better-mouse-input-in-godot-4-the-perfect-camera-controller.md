## Introduction

Let's start with the basics: **Mouse input is more complicated than you think**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Have you ever wondered why looking around feels so different between games? it is mostly because of how mouse input is handled. One may be tempted to think is a trivial issue, you just ask the mouse for the information you need and you are done. However, once we start to dig a bit deeper we can see how is more complicated than that. For example, **how often are we asking for the information?** A common mistake is to ask for it every frame. If you do this, you are asking for the last mouse event in that frame without having into account the actual motion of the mouse between them. **This will produce jittery and unreliable input that will translate into jittery and unreliable controls**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Most game engines hide all of this complex behavior and offer a simplified way of using the mouse. For example, the **Unity documentation** contains the following quote: 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> If you are using input for any kind of movement behaviour use `Input.GetAxis`. It gives you smoothed and configurable input that can be mapped to a keyboard, joystick or mouse.  
<cite><a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.html">Unity input documentation</a></cite>
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

So that's it! Problem solved, Right?. Well... *Kind of*. While this make things easier, it also implies that you have no control over how the mouse responds in your game, specially if you don't have access to the source code to take a peek of how things work under the hood.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

But I know you came here for Godot, so let's talk about how Godot handles this:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

It doesn't.

## The Godot approach

Godot has a really powerful [input system](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/inputs/input_examples.html) which works via [input events](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputevent.html) and an [input singleton](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html) in conjunction with an [input map](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputmap.html). The latter allow us to create **custom actions** assigned to specific keys, joypad buttons, and joysticks. However, **you can not use the input map to handle mouse input**. Because Godot is a general purpose engine and this is such an specific topic, there is [no consensus](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/3070) yet about how it could be implemented in a transparent way that satisfy all users. As a result, **you are expected to handle this yourself** in the way that better fits your project. Luckily **Godot provides all that is needed to implement it**, but it implies a little more care and understanding about how events work in first place.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## The pieces

The first thing to have in mind is that **there is no specific issue to blame**, the problem is a **combination of elements** that we must understand in order to achieve our goal.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Next i will cover the **5 main elements** that we will be working with in order to achieve a **better mouse control**. Although some of you will be familiar with them already, I will try to give **context and information that you may find useful**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Tip:** Because of technical limitations I am **forced** to use spaces instead of tabs for the code snippets. **If you want to save yourself some time here is a [spaces to tabs converter](https://www.browserling.com/tools/spaces-to-tabs)**. I'll be using 4 spaces per tab.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{: .notice--success}
### Input accumulation

Processing input events can become quite expensive if they are not handled carefully. Because of this, **similar input events are accumulated by default** and processed at the end of each frame, **limiting the amount of input calls to the current fps** and **deteriorating the quality** of the response. While this **improves performance** and will present **no issues for most use cases**, we can **disable** it in order to get **the most out of the input system**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> Input accumulation can be disabled to get slightly more precise/reactive input at the cost of increased CPU usage. In applications where drawing freehand lines is required, input accumulation should generally be disabled while the user is drawing the line to get results that closely follow the actual input.  
**Note**: Input accumulation is enabled by default.  
<cite><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html#class-input-property-use-accumulated-input">Godot input documentation</a></cite>
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### event.relative

Each type of `event` has it's own **properties**. In this particular case we are going be working with `event.relative`, which is a property of `InputEventMouseMotion`. **This is the property you are supposed to use for mouse control** and it's documentation read as follows:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

> The mouse position relative to the previous position (position at the last frame).  
<cite><a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputeventmousemotion.html#class-inputeventmousemotion-property-relative">Godot InputEventMouseMotion documentation</a></cite>
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

It's pretty short and **does not explain much** about it's intended use, but it **seems to imply** that this property represents the travel of the mouse from one frame to another, which has lead many users, **specially new ones**, to do something like this:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Incorrect**
{: style="text-align: center;"}
{: .notice--danger}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
var mouse_input: Vector2


func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseMotion:
        mouse_input = event.relative


func _process(delta)-> void:
    
    print(mouse_input)
    
    mouse_input = Vector2.ZERO
{% endhighlight %}


The problem is that the `event.relative` property contains the **relative position of the mouse relative to the last frame only if input accumulation is enabled**, otherwise **multiple input calls can happen in a single frame**. This means that we must **add** the new `event.relative` value to our mouse input **instead of assigning it directly**. This guarantees that it works as expected **independently of the number of calls per frame.**
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Correct**
{: style="text-align: center;"}
{: .notice--success}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
var mouse_input: Vector2


func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseMotion:
        mouse_input += event.relative


func _process(delta)-> void:
    
    print(mouse_input)
    
    mouse_input = Vector2.ZERO
{% endhighlight %}

**Note:** We set `mouse_input` to `Vector2.ZERO` because if there is no mouse movement no event will be sent and the input will never be `(0, 0)`. Because `_physics_process()` is called before `_process()`, you can still safely use `mouse_input` inside of `_physics_process()`.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{: .notice--info}

### Raw input

Godot will **automatically** use **raw mouse data** under Linux and Windows when the [mouse mode](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_input.html#enum-input-mousemode) is **set to captured**, which is the reason your **sensitivity and precision change when you capture the mouse**, as it will no longer be affected by your operating system settings.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Events are stretched too

Mouse events use [viewport coordinates](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/inputs/mouse_and_input_coordinates.html#viewport-display-coordinates) and will be affected by your [Stretch settings](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html#stretch-settings). This guarantees that mechanics such as clicking buttons, drag and drop, or making a character looks towards the mouse works as expected.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Let's say that the game viewport size is **1280x720**, the window size is **1920x1080**, [stretch mode](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html#stretch-mode) is set to `viewport`, and [stretch scale](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.html#stretch-scale) to `0.25`. If the events were not stretched accordingly there would be issues like **discrepancies between where you wanted to click and where you actually clicked**, however, **this is a problem** if we want to use the mouse as a controller, because we need the input to be constant **regardless of the window size or scaling**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

A quick **online search** about how to fix this unstability and you will stumble mostly upon people **making the same question who never got an answer**, and the the few ones who got them were suggested solutions that **may seem to minimize** the problem but **will not get rid of it completely**, neither address the root cause. So **let's clear this up once and for all**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The **events are being stretched** by the **same factors** that affect the **main window**. We could **try to manually compensate** for each factor, but we are **not going to do that**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Our main window inherits from the `viewport` class, which has the `get_final_transform()` method. As the name implies, this is the **final transform of the viewport** in reference to **it's original transform**. If the viewport and window size match perfectly, the transform reported will be `[X: (1, 0), Y: (0, 1), O: (0, 0)]`, if we **double** the window size, it will report `[X: (2, 0), Y: (0, 2), O: (0, 0)]`, and finally, if we **set the scale** to `0.75` it will be `[X: (1.5, 0), Y: (0, 1.5), O: (0, 0)]`.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

As you may suspect by this point, **applying this transform to the events will effectively cancel any stretching that may be happening to them**, and consequently to our `event.relative` values. We can do that using the `xformed_by()` method of the  `InputEvent` class. Using the example shown in [event.relative](#eventrelative) **implementing the fix would go as follows**:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
var mouse_input: Vector2


func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseMotion:
        var viewport_transform: Transform2D = get_tree().root.get_final_transform()
        mouse_input += event.xformed_by(viewport_transform).relative


func _process(delta)-> void:
    
    print(mouse_input)
    
    mouse_input = Vector2.ZERO
{% endhighlight %}

If you play with different **window sizes**, **stretch modes** and **scaling factors** you will see how your **mouse input remains perfectly constant**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**warning:** Contrary to what one could expect, even **the raw mouse input provided in** `captured` **mode is affected by this**, because again, there is [no consensus](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/57264) about it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{: .notice--warning}

### Never use delta time

Really. **I mean it**. Your mouse motion is **frame independent already**! Your mouse works by **sending packages of data** as events **every time it moves** and the **combination** of those events **results in your mouse motion**. We already know **what happened between frames**, we **do not** need to estimate it using **delta**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Not only that, because the **mouse motion is frame independent already**, multiplying it by **delta will make it frame rate dependent**! By trying to fix a problem that **does not exist**, you are **creating the problem** your were trying to fix.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Solving the puzzle

At this point you can see that I was not lying when I said that there is no specific issue to blame. All the elements that we have covered affects your mouse input, **sometimes in unexpected ways**, but now that we have a good understanding about the pieces involved and their context **it's time to solve the puzzle!** 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We are going to put all of this in practice creating a first person camera controller. We are going for the best we can get, so is going to have a performance cost. This are our goals:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

* It must be as responsive as it can.
* It must use raw input.
* Sensitivity must be stretch and scale independent.
* Sensitivity must be frame rate independent.
* The node's transforms must not deteriorate over time.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We will create the **necessary scenes first** and then **continue with the scripting**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Tip:** You can find the full project on the `downloads` category under my profile.

## Scenes

### Character scene

The character scene is as simple as it can get:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/achieving-better-mouse-input-in-godot-4-the-perfect-camera-controller/character_preview.png" alt="Scene overview" %}

* Create a new scene and click on `Other node`.
* Select `CharacterBody3D` as root node and rename it to `CharacterController`.
* Add a `CollisionShape3D` as a child of `CharacterController`.
* Click on `CollisionShape3D` and set it's `shape` to `CapsuleShape3D` with default values.
* Add a `Node3D` as a child of `CharacterController`, name it `Head` and set it's position to `(0, 0.75, 0)`.
* Add a `Node3D` as a child of `Head` and rename it `CameraContainer`.
* add a `Camera3D` as a child of `CameraContainer`.
* Add a `Node` as a child of `CharacterController` and rename it to `AimLook`.
* Save the scene as `character_controller`.
{: style="text-align: left;"}

### Test scene

You can use any scene you want for testing, but in case you want to follow this article to the letter, here is the scene I will be using:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/achieving-better-mouse-input-in-godot-4-the-perfect-camera-controller/scene_preview.png" alt="Scene overview" %}

* Create a new scene and click on `3D Scene`.
* Rename the root node to `World`.
* Click on the 3 dots next to the sun and environment preview icons and apply them clicking on `Add Sun to Scene` and `Add Environment to Scene`.
{: style="text-align: left;"}

![image-center]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/achieving-better-mouse-input-in-godot-4-the-perfect-camera-controller/environment _preview.png){: .align-center}
*Sun and Environment settings*.
{: style="text-align: center;"}

* Add a `CSGBox3D` and check `Use collision`. Set it's size to `(16, 4, 16)`.
* Add another `CSGBox3D` as a child of the first one and set the operation to `Substaction`. Set it's size to `(14, 4, 14)` and it's position to `(0, 2, 0)`.
* Add the `character_controller` scene and set it's position to `(0, 1 ,0)` so it rest perfectly on the floor.
* save the scene as `test_scene`.
* Run the project and select `Select Current` when asked for a default scene to run.
{: style="text-align: left;"}

## Scripting

### Node exports
I personally don't like direct references in my code. They are easy to break either because your renamed a node or changed it's position on the hierarchy. **Once you make a direct reference**, your code is **tightly coupled** and your **scene tree locked**. Fortunately for us there is a **better way** of doing it: `@export` annotations.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Add the following script to the `AimLook` node inside the `character_controller` scene and save it as `aim_look.gd`:
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
extends Node

#nodes
@export_group("Nodes")

#Character node.
@export var character: CharacterBody3D

#Head node.
@export var head: Node3D
{% endhighlight %}

`@export_group("Nodes")` will **export a group** to the editor called "*Nodes*". Any `@export` declared after it will be contained inside the group **until a new group is declared**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Note:** You can also end a group by declaring a new one with empty strings as parameters.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{: .notice--info}

`@export` allow us to **export a variable to the editor**. For it to work we must declare the variable type. If that type happens to be a class that inherits from `Node` (such as `CharacterBody3D`), we will be able to **assign nodes** of that class (And the ones who inherit from it) **directly from the editor**. It will also **keep track of the assigned node**, so moving the nodes around in the hierarchy **will not break the reference**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Tip:** There are several different types of exports that cover a wide range of functionalities. You can learn more about the `@export` annotations [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.html).
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{: .notice--success}

If you click on the `AimLook` node and go the `Inspector` panel, you will see a new foldable group called "*Nodes*" who contains our two variables with a **field to assign a node**. Drag and drop the `CharacterBody3D` and `head` nodes to their **corresponding fields** or click on each field and select the nodes from the list.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Mouse capture

The `MouseMode` determines how the cursor behaves. In this case, we are interested in two of them:
* `MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE` is the **default mode** and will **not interfere** at all with the cursor.
* `MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED` will **hide the cursor** and keep it **centered on the window**. It also provides **raw mouse input**. This is the usual behavior in most first person games.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We are going to work with `_unhandled_input()` instead of `_input()`. The difference between them is that, while `_input()` will be called **every time an event is received**, `_unhandled_input()` will be called **only if those events has not been consumed** already. This is useful in order to prevent capturing the mouse if you click on a 2D element such as a menu or a text box. 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

To capture the mouse we just check if the `event` class is `InputEventMouseButton`. If it is, we check if the `button_index` is `1`, which is assigned to the **left mouse button**, and change the `MouseMode` to `MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED`.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
extends Node

#nodes
@export_group("Nodes")

#Character node.
@export var character: CharacterBody3D

#Head node.
@export var head: Node3D

func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseButton:
        if event.button_index == 1:
            Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
{% endhighlight %}


Releasing the mouse is the same process. check if the event class is `InputEventKey` and if it is, check if we pressed the built it action `ui_cancel` (**escape** key by default) and set the `MouseMode` to `MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE`.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
extends Node

#nodes
@export_group("Nodes")

#Character node.
@export var character: CharacterBody3D

#Head node.
@export var head: Node3D

func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if event is InputEventMouseButton:
        if event.button_index == 1:
            Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
    
        return
    
    if event is InputEventKey:
        if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
            Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)
{% endhighlight %}

**Tip:** Because processing input can be expensive, specially with mouse accumulation disabled, is a good idea to return from the *_unhandled_input()* function as soon as you can to save unnecessary checks and keep the code clean. In this case, once we have checked if the event class is `InputEventMouseButton` only two things can happen: Either is a left click and we should return, or is not and we should return anyway. Because the outcome is the same, we can save an extra line by just returning after whatever happened with the event.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
{: .notice--success}

### Quitting the game
Lets say we want to add some **quality of life improvements**, such as **closing the game instead of releasing the mouse** if the mouse is **already released**, or **look around** only **when the mouse is captured**. Of course, your could add a few `if` and `else` statements and never look back. But that implies **more code** and **more levels of indentation**, which is not ideal.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

If you think about what we are trying to do, we only care about **capturing the mouse** or **quitting the game** if the **mouse is not captured already**, so lets wrap that into an `if` statement who checks if the mouse is ***not*** captured. We don't need to return from the quit game check because well, it will quit the game. We do not need to return from the capture mouse check either because is the last check inside our `if Input.mouse_mode != Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED:` statement. We will **always return** from that statement, because **if the mouse is not captured** we **do not want to do anything more**. Now we can assume that **whatever happens** after that statement **happens with the mouse captured**, which is ideal to do our release mouse check.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
extends Node

#nodes
@export_group("Nodes")

#Character node.
@export var character: CharacterBody3D

#Head node.
@export var head: Node3D

func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if Input.mouse_mode != Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED:
        if event is InputEventKey:
            if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
                get_tree().quit()
                
        if event is InputEventMouseButton:
            if event.button_index == 1:
                Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
                
        return
    
    if event is InputEventKey:
        if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
            Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)
{% endhighlight %}

Look at that! The code is **clean** and **efficient** and it's functionality is **clear**... and not a single `else` to be found!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

### Disabling input accumulation

As we have discussed already, [input accumulation](#input-accumulation) must be **disabled in order to get more responsive input**. Depending on the mouse [poll rate](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/explorer/gamer/mice/what-is-polling-rate-does-it-affect-gaming/) and assuming Godot is able to process all the events this **could translate into thousands of calls per second**. That's why disabling input accumulation can become so expensive.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

That said, disabling it is pretty easy. One line inside the `_ready()` function will do the work.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
extends Node

#nodes
@export_group("Nodes")

#Character node.
@export var character: CharacterBody3D

#Head node.
@export var head: Node3D

func _ready():
    Input.set_use_accumulated_input(false)


func _unhandled_input(event)-> void:
    if Input.mouse_mode != Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED:
        if event is InputEventKey:
            if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
                get_tree().quit()
	    
        if event is InputEventMouseButton:
            if event.button_index == 1:
                Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
        
        return

    if event is InputEventKey:
        if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
            Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)
{% endhighlight %}

### Yaw and Pitch

Create **two methods** to add yaw and pitch named `add_yaw()` and `add_pitch()`. Both will **rotate a node** by a given **amount** specified in **degrees** and **orthonormalize** it to prevent it's transform from deteriorating, the only **difference** between them is the **node** they rotate and the **axis** in which they do it.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

In order to prevent [gimbal lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock) the whole `CharacterController` node is rotated to perform **yaw** and the `Head` node will take care of the **pitch**.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% highlight gdscript linenos %}
extends Node

#nodes
@export_group("Nodes")

#Character root node.
@export var character : CharacterBody3D

#Head node.
@export var head : Node3D


func _ready():
    Input.set_use_accumulated_input(false)


func _unhandled_input(event)->void:
    if Input.mouse_mode != Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED:
        if event is InputEventKey:
            if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
                    get_tree().quit()
        
        if event is InputEventMouseButton:
            if event.button_index == 1:
                Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_CAPTURED)
        
        return
    
    if event is InputEventKey:
            if event.is_action_pressed("ui_cancel"):
                Input.set_mouse_mode(Input.MOUSE_MODE_VISIBLE)


#Rotates the character around the local Y axis by a given amount (In degrees) to achieve yaw.
func add_yaw(amount)->void:
    if is_zero_approx(amount):
        return
    
    character.rotate_object_local(Vector3.DOWN, deg_to_rad(amount))
    character.orthonormalize()


#Rotates the head around the local x axis by a given amount (In degrees) to achieve pitch.
func add_pitch(amount)->void:
    if is_zero_approx(amount):
        return
    
    head.rotate_object_local(Vector3.LEFT, deg_to_rad(amount))
    head.orthonormalize()
{% endhighlight %}

### Pitch clamp

We are going to need an extra method called `clamp_pitch()` to **clamp** our `head` node **local x rotation** between our desired **minimum** and **maximum** pitch. We will export those values to the editor for convenience and place them inside a **subgroup** called `Clamp settings` under a **group** called `Settings`.

### Aim look
Now we are ready to start **looking around**!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/achieving-better-mouse-input-in-godot-4-the-perfect-camera-controller/aim_look_preview.gif" alt="Aim_look() preview" %}

Export another **subgroup** called `Mouse settings` inside the `Settings` **group** that will contain a **variable** called `mouse_sensitivity`. This **subgroup** will be declared **before** the `Clamp settings` one to keep things organized.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

We are going to use the `@export_range` [annotation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.html#limiting-editor-input-ranges), which allow us to **limit the range** of the exported variable on the editor and the **increment/decrement step**. The type and range of this variable **is up to you**, but in my case `mouse_sensitivity` will be an `int`, the **range** will be `1 to 100` (in order to prevent a value of 0), the **step** will be `1`, and the **default value** `50`.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

The `aim_look()` method will take an `InputEventMouseMotion` event as a **parameter**. Because we took care of creating methods for yaw, pitch, and clamping already, **the content of the method is pretty straightforward**. We **assign** the `relative` property of the `event` to a **new local variable** called `motion` that will be **later multiplied** by `mouse_sensitivity`. However, as we seen in [Disabling input accumulation](#disabling-input-accumulation), most modern mouses have a **high DPI**, which means we will receive **large values**. This will force us to use **really small values on the editor** which is not ideal, specially since **Godot only allows 3 decimals** by default. To solve this, we are going to create **another local variable** named `degrees_per_unit` to multiply our motion with it. I chosen a value of **0.001**, which is a **0.1% of a degree per unit**, which happens to work pretty well with our scale of `0 to 100` using a mouse with 1000 DPI.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

After that we just call our `add_yaw()`, `add_pitch()`, and `clamp_pitch()` methods and all that's left to do is call the `aim_look()` method inside `_unhandled_input()` and pass it the corresponding event.

### Stretching the input back

Finally, we are going to address one infamous issue present on lots of Godot games and official demos. **If you are using scaling or any kind of window stretching**, whatever it is `canvas_items` or `viewport`, **the events are being stretched too** in reference to the window original size and scale. In the **best case scenario**, the user scales the window causing **the sensitivity of the mouse to change**, in the **worst case scenario** you have set your stretch mode to `ignore` which results in **different sensitivities** for the `x` and `y` axis if the window is stretched by the user. I already gave a [detailed explanation](#events-are-stretched-too) about why this happens and how to fix it, but all we need to remember right now is that **transforming our events** by the **main window final transform** will **cancel** all this undesired side effects.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

To make things cleaner, we declare a new variable called `viewport_transform` who contains the current **main window final transform** and **modify the motion variable** to take it into account with the `xformed_by()` method.

## Final notes

Let's be honest, that was a lot of text already and I have no intention of making it any longer. If I did my work well now you have a better understanding of how mouse input works in Godot and everything you need to put it in practice. The puzzle is solved... it is time to enjoy the view.
